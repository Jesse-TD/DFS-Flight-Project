Flight Planning System
Overview

The Flight Planning System is a Java-based application designed to determine all possible flight plans for a person traveling between two cities serviced by an airline. The system considers various legs of flights, their associated costs, and travel times, providing users with optimal routes based on specific criteria.
Features

    Graph-Based Representation: The project utilizes a graph-based approach to represent the network of flights between different cities.

    Iterative Backtracking Algorithm: An efficient backtracking algorithm is implemented to find all possible flight plans, considering constraints such as time and cost.

    Object-Oriented Design: The solution is implemented with a focus on object-oriented principles, using linked lists and stacks to manage flight data and traversal.

    Flight Request Processing: The system processes flight requests, calculates optimal routes, and generates formatted output for user-friendly presentation.
